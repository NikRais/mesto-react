## Review

This project is realized during studying at [Yandex Praktikum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) for web-developers.
Mesto (or 'Place' in English) is performed as an interactive web page for posting pictures and gaining likes.

## Applied decisions in Project No.4:

* form validation performance via JavaScript and JSX code;
* ability to like and dislike (by removing your like) cards;
* updating user's avarar;
* updating user's info;
* BEM methodology in file structure (nested);
* CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout;
* pseudo-classes for CSS selectors;
* CSS transition;
* media queries for desctop and mobile versions (from 1280px to 320px);

## What to improve

Registration ability on the site.
